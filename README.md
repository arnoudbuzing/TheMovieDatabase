# Wolfram Language interface to The Movie Database

Free and open source [Wolfram Language](https://www.wolfram.com/language) interface to the [Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

## API key

Requires an API key from the Movie Database, which must be obtained separately.

This API must be stored in the Wolfram Language as follows:

```
SystemCredential["TMDB"] = "*** your api key ****" ;
```

This credential is stored permanently on your system, see [SystemCredential](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SystemCredential.html) for details.
